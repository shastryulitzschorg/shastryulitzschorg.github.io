This is a shared blog of Bhargava Shastry and Vincent Ulitzsch. Our joint work focuses on discovering vulnerabilities via fuzz-testing, which we blog about here.

## Bhargava Shastry
I am a security engineer at the [Ethereum Foundation][7] in the Solidity team. In my spare time, I am a freelance security researcher.

I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science at the chair for [Security in Telecommunications][1] (SecT), TU Berlin in 2018. My dissertation is titled __Compiler Assisted Vulnerability Assessment__. I obtained an M.Sc. in computer science from [EPFL][2] and a B.Tech in electrical engineering from [NITK][3].

I have developed software for [Ittiam Systems][4], and conducted research on mobile systems security at the [Fraunhofer SIT][5], and [Rice University computer security lab][6].

## Vincent Ulitzsch

I am graduate student at TU Berlin and employed as a working student at Security Research Labs, 
a Berlin based Security Consulting & Research company. I graduated from Technical University of Berlin with outstanding results, including an exchange semester at ETH Zurich - I presented part of my Bachelor's thesis at [Blackhat USA in 2018](https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Thu-August-9/us-18-Ulitzsch-Follow-The-White-Rabbit-Simplifying-Fuzz-Testing-Using-FuzzExMachina.pdf).  
I have been a fellow of the "Deutschlandstipendium"-scholarship for three years now.
